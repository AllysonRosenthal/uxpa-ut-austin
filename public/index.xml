      <description>Brent Biglin: After attending the UXPA International Conference for the first time this past year, Kelsey Belcher, Eric Graham, Kathryn Golden, and I decided to start one of the first UXPA student chapters at the University of Texas at Austin. We&amp;rsquo;ve met the past two weeks on Tuesday evenings to sort out our charter and bylaws in order to start taking members and creating events for the Fall 2017 semester.</description>

      <description>To join the User Experience Professionals Association of UT Austin, all you have to do is be a student of UT Austin and have an interest in user experience design, research, and evaluation. While not required to be a member of our chapter, becoming a member of UXPA International is required in order to be a voting member or board member.
Our goal is to create events and programs to benefit the UX community at the iSchool and UT in general, as well as to connect our students with the international UX community through UXPA International.</description>

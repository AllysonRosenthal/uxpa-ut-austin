To join the User Experience Professionals Association of UT Austin, all you have to do is be a student of UT Austin and have an interest in user experience design, research, and evaluation.

Fall 2017 will be the inaugural semester of the UXPA UT Austin student chapter. Our goal will be to create events and programs to benefit the UX community at the iSchool and UT in general, as well as to connect our students with the international UX community through UXPA. We hope to have a significant showing at the UXPA International Conference next June in Puerto Rico from June 26â€“28.

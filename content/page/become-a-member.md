To join the User Experience Professionals Association of UT Austin, all you have to do is be a student of UT Austin and have an interest in user experience design, research, and evaluation.

Fall 2017 will be the inaugural semester of the UXPA UT Austin student chapter. Our goal will be to create events and programs to benefit the UX community at the iSchool and UT in general, as well as to connect our students with the international UX community through UXPA. We hope to have a significant showing at the UXPA International Conference next June in Puerto Rico from June 26â€“28.

Our goal this summer is to find ten of us to commit to becoming members of both UXPA and our student chapter, which is our next step to becoming a fully-fledged chapter. Then, we want to meet and make plans to be a part of orientation for incoming students for the fall 2017 semester as well as to create a mentorship program for new UX students.

Not only do you have the opportunity to be a founding member of our UXPA student chapter and to have a significant influence on our direction moving forward, but the first 5 students who are willing to commit to becoming members will receive a complimentary membership to UXPA (a $35 value).

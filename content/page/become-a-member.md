To join the User Experience Professionals Association of UT Austin, all you have to do is be a student of UT Austin and have an interest in user experience design, research, and evaluation. While not required to be a member of our chapter, [becoming a member of UXPA International](https://uxpa.org/membership/student-member) is required in order to be a voting member or board member.

Our goal is to create events and programs to benefit the UX community at the iSchool and UT in general, as well as to connect our students with the international UX community through UXPA International.

For further information about events, programs or to collaborate with us, email us at [uxpautaustin@gmail.com](mailto:uxpautaustin@gmail.com).

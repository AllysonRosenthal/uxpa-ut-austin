### Ali Funnell

Hi, everyone! My name is Ali Funnell, I’m a first-year student at the iSchool, interested in pursuing a path in User Experience/User Interface Design.
 
My first exposure to the term ‘UX/UI’ was during a networking event. As I listened to a speaker enthusiastically describe human-computer interaction and user interface design, it sparked something inside me. The synthesis of technology and design in a field applicable to a broad range of industries excited me. I was currently working in the petroleum industry and had experience as a production accountant. I found that I was able to be successful in my job, but my interests and career were mismatched, and my soul was not stirred. When the petroleum industry entered a downturn, I realized it presented an opportunity to further my education in a program that could intersect technical abilities with creative abilities in order to pursue a career in the field of UX/UI.
 
I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business finance from Texas Tech. Additionally, I have nurtured a passion for creative design throughout my life. I have continuously pursued learning various mediums of art such as illustration, graphic design, and video. I’m very excited to build upon my skill set and equip myself with the concepts and tools necessary to be an effective contributor to the emerging industry of User Experience.

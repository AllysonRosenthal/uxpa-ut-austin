### Brent Biglin:

After attending the UXPA International Conference for the first time this past year, Kelsey Belcher, Eric Graham, Kathryn Golden, and I decided to start one of the first UXPA student chapters at the University of Texas at Austin. We've met the past two weeks on Tuesday evenings to sort out our charter and bylaws in order to start taking members and creating events for the Fall 2017 semester.

We're still putting all of the pieces together and we're really excited to connect the amazing students at UT Austin with the international UX community represented by UXPA. Stay tuned!
